            <h3>Front End Lead</h3>
            <p>Hello, I am the front end lead of the team. I love to find new
                coding challenges to solve. I also enjoy outdoor activities since
                our major requires us to be in front of a computer. I plan to help
                make our project look as great as it can and I am excited to see
                what I can learn from this project.
            </p>
